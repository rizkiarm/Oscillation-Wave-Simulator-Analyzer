Oscillation Wave Simulator & Analyzer
=====================================
A hybrid program to simulate the process of oscillation wave, superposition & interference of wave, and real-life phenomena of wave concepts. A final project for Fundamental Physics II course (2014).

Written in HTML, CSS, Javascript. Uses jQuery, jQuery UI, and Font Awesome.

Description
-----------
This program have three features.

**Single Wave Mode**

In this mode, you can adjust each variables and see the results (animation, math function, and some other stuffs) instantly.

**Interference / Superposition **

In this mode, you can run a simulation of two colliding waves. You can tweak each wave variables and see how it results in the behaviour of the collided wave.

**Ocean Wave Simulator** 

As it name implies, this mode allows you to view the ocean wave simulation based on some variables that you can tweak. You can also see the effect of such ocean wave on an object.

Usage
-----
Follow this steps to run the app:

1. Clone this repository
2. You can either build the app using Node-Webkit, or simply just run the ``index.html`` file
